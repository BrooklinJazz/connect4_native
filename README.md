# Mix4

Mix4 is a demo application for [LiveViewNative](https://github.com/liveview-native/liveview-native-core) used in my talk at Elixir Conf US 2023.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

To run the application in IOS, use XCode to open the native/Mix4 project, then build/run your ios simulator or connected device.
